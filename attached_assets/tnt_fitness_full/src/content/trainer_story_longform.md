# Coach Rico — Revelation & Evolution
**Revelation — Why I Became a Trainer**  
I was born into a fight for breath. Asthma dominated my childhood. Thanks to my mother’s job at Mount Sinai East, I was often in emergency rooms. At ten, I chose sport. Coaches worried and benched me—frustration became fuel to perform and to keep showing up.

In 2019 a freight elevator door collapsed on my head at work. The MRI read: **severe brain contusions and concussion; cervical spine damage (C1–C5); lumbar damage (L5–L7)**. I spent two years in cognitive and physical therapy, and a year and a half learning to walk without support.

**Evolution — What I Do Now**  
In 2024 I formalized the work—returning to school, earning **three personal trainer certifications** and a **nutritionist certification**. My coaching is built on recovery: *breath before load, posture before power, consistency over everything.*

**Philosophy**  
Fitness is more than reps. It served and saved me—now it’s your turn. **Are you ready?**
